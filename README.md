Hello! ðŸ˜„

I am a front-end developer and visual designer with six years of experience building and improving websites and apps using different technologies and collaborating with engineering teams, product owners and visual and UX designers. I worked many years with javascript, typescript and CSS languages, using libraries such as React, Node.js and Next.js. I also have a good working experience with Figma, both as a developer working with interaction and visual designers and creating my own visual designs.

My greatest strength is conveying the brand message through visual aesthetic while writing clean and efficient code. I am also dedicated to enhance applications' style and user experience during interactions. I have a talent for public speaking and documenting projects in a clear yet concise way.

I am passionate about advocating for workplace equality for women from all backgrounds and committed to developing innovative products that support this mission. I hold values of integrity, courage, and empathy at the forefront of my work. Finally, I am driven by curiosity to continuously learn, refine my skills and explore new ideas and tools.
