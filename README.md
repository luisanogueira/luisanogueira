Hello! ðŸ˜„

I am LuÃ­sa, a brazilian / portuguese front-end developer who loves to work with CSS, JavaScript and React.js!
I am also loving UX Design more and more each day, and intend to specialize in this area once I have more experience.

I am currently working at Workflow EDV in Vienna, Austria. 
I came here for a bootcamp in full-stack web development but after the bootcamp I got this job and decided to stay in this amazing city!
I can't imagine a better home for me.

Starting from september 2020, I will finish my contract at Workflow and am open for new working opportunities!
It has been a great experience so far, but I am ready for this new phase in my life.

What I am looking for?
- To collaborate on open source projects so I can learn more and help in any way I can, either solving bugs or improving different aspects of the project.
- To meet other developers living in Austria or around Europe and get in touch, have a coffee, share knowledge.
- To keep track of my own progress in different projects I will work on.

Cheers!
