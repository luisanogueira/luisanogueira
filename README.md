Hello! ðŸ˜„

I am LuÃ­sa, a brazilian / portuguese front-end developer who loves to work with CSS, JavaScript and React.js!
I am also loving UX Design more and more each day, and intend to specialize in this area once I have more experience.

I've been living in Europe since end of 2015. I studied in Coimbra, Portugal and later moved to Lisbon and worked with marketing.
Since I wanted to have a new adventure and new experiences, I came to Austria for a bootcamp in full-stack web development. 
After the bootcamp I got a job at an IT company and decided to stay in the amazing city of Vienna!
I can't imagine a better home for me.

What I am looking for?
- To collaborate on open source projects so I can learn more and help in any way I can, either solving bugs or improving different aspects of the project.
- To meet other developers living in Austria or around Europe and get in touch, have a coffee, share knowledge.
- To keep track of my own progress in different projects I will work on.
- Learn more every day.

Cheers!
